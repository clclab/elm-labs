# Welcome to the Evolamus Computer Labs

This website contains the lab assignments for the Evolution of Language & Music course. You can access the assignments through the menu on the left.

For the _Bioacoustics in Praat_ lab, you will need to download the [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) software. The _Evolution & phylogenetic reconstruction_ lab can be run in Google Colab. To open a lab assignment in Colab, go to the assignment page and hover your mouse over the rocket symbol ( <img alt="rocket" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/rocket.svg" width="20" height="20"> ) in the top right, then choose _Colab_. Once on Colab, **don't forget to make a copy of the notebook in your own Drive to save your changes**. If you prefer working in your own local jupyter environment, you can also download ( <img alt="rocket" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/solid/download.svg" width="20" height="20"> ) the .ipynb file.
